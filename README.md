Bayesian Deep Learning for Lung cancer Classification

A robust deep learning framework for classifying lung cancer from chest CT scans using Bayesian neural networks with uncertainty quantification, specifically designed for extremely imbalanced medical dataset.

üè• Overview
This project implements a Bayesian deep learning system for lung cancer classification from chest CT scans, addressing the critical need for uncertainty quantification in medical AI. The system provides both diagnostic predictions and clinically-relevant confidence measures essential for radiologist trust and patient safety.
